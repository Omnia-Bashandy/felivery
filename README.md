# Felivery Project

Welcome to the **Felivery Project**! This project is a web application developed using Angular, aimed at streamlining the delivery process for customers and delivery personnel. Below youâ€™ll find instructions and information on how to set up, build, and run the project, along with some additional resources for further assistance.

## Project Overview

Felivery is designed to simplify and manage delivery services, providing an intuitive interface for tracking orders, managing deliveries, and ensuring timely service. The project utilizes Angular CLI version 16.0.0 for development, offering robust features and a modular architecture.

## Getting Started

### Development Server

To start a development server:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload whenever you make changes to any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

To generate a new component, service, directive, or other Angular constructs, use the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

Replace `component-name` with your desired component name. You can also generate other constructs using:

```bash
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module name
```

### Building the Project

To compile the project and create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The compiled output will be placed in the `dist/` directory. These files can be deployed to a web server.

### Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for your project, use the Karma test runner:

```bash
ng test
```

This command will run all the unit tests and display the results in the console, helping you ensure that individual components and services behave as expected.

### Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (E2E) testing:

1. First, install a package that supports E2E testing, such as Protractor or Cypress:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev protractor
   ```
2. Run the E2E tests using:
   ```bash
   ng e2e
   ```

This will execute the tests across your application, simulating user interactions and verifying the overall functionality.
